This area i used for the Sector B script (by Suppe). You can just put it on your server or you can use it for the Sector B as well.

If you want to use it for the Sector addon just replace your mission.sqm with the provided one.

If you didn`t do any changes to your altis.h then just replace yours with mine.


If you already got your file edited then just copy/paste the lines from my sector.txt (and don`t forget to place commas if needed).

In case you need help with installation process just contact me:
