This area i used for the Sector B script (by Suppe). You can just put it on your server or you can use it for the Sector B as well.

If you didn`t do any changes to your altis.h then just replace yours with mine.


If you already got your file edited then just copy/paste the lines from my sector.txt (and don`t forget to place commas if needed).
